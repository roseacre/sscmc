            and re-develop the whole site.</p>

            <p class="general-text">The new church premises, largely above shops in the centre of Blackpool, were opened on Saturday 15th March 1975 by
            Miss Charlotte Briggs, the oldest member of the Society at that time and dedicated by the then Chairman of the District, the Rev. G. Herbert Raynor.</p>
