        began meeting in the Temperance Hall, between Bolton Street and South Parade. However, in 1869, they purchased land in Rawcliffe St and built
        the Rawcliffe Street Ebenezer Wesleyan Chapel, which opened on 2 September 1869. The building could seat 350 worshippers. The architects
        were Thomas Bird and Sons of Manchester, and the builder was RW Braithwaite of Blackpool. </p>
