        <div>
            <p class="general-text padded-top"><span class="bold">1910</span> - Salem Primitive Methodist Church was founded by the Chapel Street Primitive
            Methodist Church. They began worshipping in a stable loft in Westcliffe Drive, Layton, but an iron mission hall was soon
            built on the site. It was originally to be called 'Bethel' but ended up being 'Salem'.
            It was nicknamed ‘The Iron Mission’.</p>

			<p class="general-text"><span class="bold">1939</span> - The current Salem Methodist Church, on Westcliffe Drive, was opened on the 5 July 1939.
			It was almost immediately used as a school for Manchester evacuees. The original iron hut remained alongside for some time.</p>

			<p class="general-text"><span class="bold">2019</span> - the name 'Layton Methodist Church' was adopted.</p>

			<p class="general-text">The building is included on a Blackpool Council List of buildings of
			historical significance.</p>
