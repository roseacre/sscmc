            <p>A short summary of the Church beliefs will be
            presented here.</p>

            <p>Every church should make their statement of faith visible and easily accessible. If part of a denomination,
                chances are the information is available on a main website for the whole denomination or network, but it
                still might be good to summarize what the statement of faith is in an original and unique way that can speak
                to the specific context that the local church is in. Without a statement of faith, it is hard for people to
                know the church's official stance on doctrine.</p>
